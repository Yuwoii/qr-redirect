# QR Code Style and Color Testing Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the testing performed to verify that all QR code styles correctly apply custom colors in our QR code generator. 

Previously, there was an issue where only the Forest Green color theme would work with QR code styles other than Classic. 
Our testing confirms that this issue has been resolved, and all styles (Classic, Rounded, Dots, Corner Dots, and Hybrid) 
correctly display with all custom color themes.

## Testing Approach

We adopted a comprehensive testing approach:

1. **Code Review** - Examined the implementation of the QR code drawing functions in `src/lib/qrcode.ts` to ensure that:
   - The context fill style is correctly set for each drawing operation
   - Helper functions like `drawRoundedSquare` and `drawCircle` explicitly set the fill color
   - All styles consistently use the color parameters passed to them

2. **Automated Testing** - Created and ran the `test-color-application.js` script that:
   - Tests all style templates (Classic, Rounded, Dots, Corner Dots, Hybrid)
   - Tests all color themes (Black & White, Forest Green, Red, Blue, Purple)
   - Generates visual examples of each style/color combination
   - Verifies the pixel colors in the generated QR codes match the expected colors

3. **Visual Verification** - Examined the generated QR codes in the `tools/qr-test-output` directory to visually confirm:
   - The QR codes display properly with the correct visual style
   - The colors are applied correctly and consistently across all styles
   - There are no rendering issues or anomalies

## Test Results

Our tests confirmed the following:

1. **Color Application** - All QR code styles now correctly apply the custom colors:
   - The dark (foreground) color is correctly applied to all module shapes (squares, dots, rounded squares)
   - The light (background) color is consistently applied to the QR code background

2. **Style Rendering** - All style variations render correctly with their distinctive visual characteristics:
   - Classic: Square modules and corners
   - Rounded: Rounded modules and corners
   - Dots: Circular modules
   - Corner Dots: Square modules with circular corner dots
   - Hybrid: Square modules with rounded corners

3. **Color Consistency** - Colors are consistently applied across:
   - Standard modules in the data region
   - Finder patterns (corner squares)
   - Corner dots

## Implementation Details

The key improvements that fixed the color application issues were:

1. In `drawCustomQRCode` function:
   - Explicitly setting the fill style for each drawing operation
   - Using the `darkColor` variable consistently for all drawing operations

2. In helper functions:
   - Adding a `color` parameter to `drawRoundedSquare` and `drawCircle`
   - Explicitly setting the fill style inside these functions
   - Using `save()` and `restore()` to maintain context state

## Conclusion

The QR code generator now correctly applies custom colors to all QR code styles. This ensures a consistent and expected user experience when customizing QR codes.

The test file and generated outputs serve as a reference for future development and regression testing to ensure these issues don't recur.

## Test Artifacts

- **Test Script**: `tools/test-color-application.js`
- **Test Outputs**: `tools/qr-test-output/*.png` (25 test images for all style/color combinations)
- **Component Test**: `tools/test-qr-customizer.js` (verifies the customizer component implementation)

This testing confirms that the QR code customization feature is now fully functional with respect to color application across all style templates.
