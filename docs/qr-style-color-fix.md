# QR Code Style Color Fix

## Issue Overview

There was a critical issue with QR code generation where custom colors were only properly applied to the "Classic" and "Forest" style templates. When users selected other style templates like "Rounded", "Dots", "Corner Dots", or "Hybrid" along with custom colors, the colors were not properly applied. Specifically:

1. The background color would apply correctly to all styles
2. The dark (foreground) color would only apply correctly to the Classic and Forest styles
3. For other styles, the dark color would always default to black regardless of user selection

This created inconsistency in the user experience and limited the customization options available to users.

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, the root cause was identified in the `drawCustomQRCode` function in `src/lib/qrcode.ts`:

1. The canvas context's fill style was not being properly applied before drawing each QR code module
2. Helper drawing functions for rounded squares and circles were not handling colors correctly
3. The context state wasn't being saved/restored properly in the drawing operations

Specifically:
- The `fillStyle` property was being set at the module level, but this setting wasn't consistently used by the helper functions
- The helper functions (`drawRoundedSquare` and `drawCircle`) were using the current context state without explicitly setting the color
- Context state wasn't being properly managed with `save()` and `restore()` calls in some cases

## Solution Implemented

The following changes were made to fix the issue:

### 1. Updated `drawCustomQRCode` Function

- Now explicitly sets the background color for the entire canvas first
- Stores the dark color in a variable for consistent reference
- Sets the fill style explicitly before each drawing operation
- Uses consistent color application for all module types

### 2. Updated Helper Functions

- Modified `drawRoundedSquare` and `drawCircle` to accept a `color` parameter
- Added explicit `fillStyle` assignment inside these functions
- Implemented proper context state management with `save()` and `restore()`

### 3. Made Functions Exportable

- Changed the function declarations from private to exported functions
- This allows better component integration and testing

### 4. Added Comprehensive Testing

A dedicated test page (`/qr-test`) was created to verify all combinations of:
- All 6 QR code style templates
- Multiple color combinations
- Diagnostic tools for verifying correct color application

## Verification

The fix has been tested and verified to work correctly. All QR code styles (Classic, Forest, Rounded, Dots, Corner Dots, Hybrid) now correctly display the custom colors selected by the user.

The testing page provides diagnostic information including:
- Color matching verification
- Success rates for each style template
- Visual comparison of expected vs. actual colors

## Implementation Details

The following files were modified or created:

1. `src/lib/qrcode.ts` - Updated drawing functions with proper color handling
2. `src/components/QRCodeCustomizer.tsx` - Fixed preview generation
3. `src/app/qr-test/page.tsx` - Added comprehensive test page
4. `src/app/qr-test/layout.tsx` - Layout for test page

## Future Improvements

While the current fix resolves the immediate issue, future work could include:
1. Refactoring the QR code generation into a more modular architecture
2. Adding unit tests specifically for color application
3. Creating a style template system that's more extensible
4. Implementing color validation to ensure good contrast ratios
