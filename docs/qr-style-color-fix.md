# QR Code Style Color Fix

## Issue Description

The QR code customization feature had a color application issue where custom colors were only correctly applied to the Forest and Classic styles. Other styles (Rounded, Dots, Corner Dots, Hybrid) were not properly inheriting the selected colors, resulting in inconsistent appearance across different style templates.

## Root Cause

After investigating the codebase, the issue was found in the `drawCustomQRCode` function in `src/lib/qrcode.ts`. The function was setting the fill style color only once at the beginning:

```typescript
// Set drawing styles
ctx.fillStyle = options.color?.dark || '#000000';
```

However, subsequent drawing operations for various styles and components (rounded corners, corner dots, dots, etc.) were not re-setting the fill style before drawing, resulting in some styles not using the correct color.

## Fix Implementation

The issue was fixed by:

1. Setting the background color explicitly for the entire canvas:
   ```typescript
   // Set background color for the entire canvas
   ctx.fillStyle = options.color?.light || '#ffffff';
   ctx.fillRect(0, 0, (options.width || 300), (options.width || 300));
   ```

2. Storing the dark color in a variable for easy reference:
   ```typescript
   // Dark color for QR modules
   const darkColor = options.color?.dark || '#000000';
   ```

3. Explicitly setting the fill style before each drawing operation:
   ```typescript
   // Always ensure we're using the correct color before drawing
   ctx.fillStyle = darkColor;
   ```

4. Updating the helper drawing functions to save and restore the canvas context to preserve drawing settings:
   ```typescript
   function drawRoundedSquare(...) {
     // Save current context state
     ctx.save();
     
     // ... drawing operations ...
     
     // Restore context state
     ctx.restore();
   }
   ```

## Testing

A comprehensive test page was created at `/qr-test` that renders all available style templates with multiple color combinations. The page visualizes:

- Classic style with standard and custom colors
- Forest style with standard and custom colors
- Rounded style with standard and custom colors
- Dots style with standard and custom colors
- Corner Dots style with standard and custom colors
- Hybrid style with standard and custom colors

## QR Code Style Templates

The application supports the following QR code style templates:

| Style Name | Description | Style Properties |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Classic | Standard QR code design | `dotShape: 'square', cornerShape: 'square', cornerDotStyle: 'square'` |
| Forest | QR code with rounded corners | `dotShape: 'square', cornerShape: 'rounded', cornerDotStyle: 'square'` |
| Rounded | Smoother appearance with rounded dots | `dotShape: 'rounded', cornerShape: 'rounded', cornerDotStyle: 'square'` |
| Dots | Circular dots for a modern look | `dotShape: 'dots', cornerShape: 'square', cornerDotStyle: 'square'` |
| Corner Dots | Special dot style for corners | `dotShape: 'square', cornerShape: 'square', cornerDotStyle: 'dot'` |
| Hybrid | Mix of rounded dots and corners | `dotShape: 'dots', cornerShape: 'rounded', cornerDotStyle: 'dot'` |

## Canvas Drawing Functions

The QR code rendering is done using canvas drawing operations. The key functions are:

- `drawCustomQRCode`: Renders the QR code with various style options
- `drawRoundedSquare`: Helper function to draw squares with rounded corners
- `drawCircle`: Helper function to draw circular elements

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements for the QR code customization include:

1. Adding a color contrast check to ensure QR codes are still readable
2. Implementing more style options (dashed lines, patterns, etc.)
3. Adding style-specific previews that show the actual style with colors
4. Creating a more efficient rendering method for frequently used styles
5. Implementing browser-based testing to verify correct rendering across browsers
