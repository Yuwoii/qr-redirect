- **Logo Integration**: Implemented functionality to embed logos within QR codes
- **Canvas-based Rendering**: Utilized canvas for enhanced visual effects and styling

### Components Created
1. **EnhancedQRCode**: A comprehensive component that provides:
   - Custom styling of QR codes
   - Real-time preview of changes
   - Built-in customization dialog

## Technical Implementation

### Client-Side Canvas Support
We've made the QR code generation library work seamlessly in both server and client environments by:
- Adding conditional imports for the canvas package
- Creating client-side polyfills for canvas operations
- Ensuring proper error handling in both environments

### New API Endpoints
- `/api/qrcodes/[id]` - GET: Retrieves QR code data for customization

### Custom Styling Logic
- **Dot Shapes**: Implemented square, rounded, and circular dot styles
- **Corner Styling**: Added special handling for QR code corner patterns
- **Logo Embedding**: Created positioning and sizing logic for centered logos
- **Background/Foreground Colors**: Added support for custom color schemes

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```jsx
// Display a basic customizable QR code
<EnhancedQRCode 
  url="https://example.com" 
  size={250}
  showCustomizeButton={true}
  showDownloadButton={true}
/>
```

### Pre-styled QR Code
```jsx
// Display a pre-styled QR code with custom colors and shapes
<EnhancedQRCode

  initialOptions={{
    color: { dark: '#0f766e', light: '#f0fdfa' },
    style: { dotShape: 'rounded', cornerShape: 'rounded' }
  }}
  showCustomizeButton={true}

```

### Using the Customizer Component Directly
