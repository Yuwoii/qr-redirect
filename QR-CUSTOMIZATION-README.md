### Components Created
1. **EnhancedQRCode**: A comprehensive component that provides:
   - Custom styling of QR codes

## Technical Implementation

### Client-Side Canvas Support
We've made the QR code generation library work seamlessly in both server and client environments by:
- Adding conditional imports for the canvas package
- Creating client-side polyfills for canvas operations
- Ensuring proper error handling in both environments

### Dynamic Preview Generation
- Real-time generation of QR code previews for style templates
- Caching mechanism to prevent unnecessary re-rendering
- Optimized small-size QR codes for preview thumbnails

### New API Endpoints
- `/api/qrcodes/[id]` - GET: Retrieves QR code data for customization

### Custom Styling Logic
- **Dot Shapes**: Implemented square, rounded, and circular dot styles
- **Corner Styling**: Added special handling for QR code corner patterns
- **Logo Embedding**: Created positioning and sizing logic for centered logos
- **Background/Foreground Colors**: Added support for custom color schemes

## Usage Examples
